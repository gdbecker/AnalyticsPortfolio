# Power BI Professional Work Portfolio

This is a collection of selected projects I've worked on during my time as an analyst & consultant at Elliott Davis, from 2021-2023. Before joining I had no prior experience in Power BI or any business intelligence development, and it has been wonderful to aid clients in discovering more about their data while also building aesthetically pleasing frontend dashboards to present insights. All PDFs are exports of .pbix files I've worked on, and the data is scrubbed/modified to protect client identities. See below for brief project summaries and check out each folder's README for more details. Thank you!

## Projects Overview

### 01 Healthcare Practice Demos

These are a set of Power BI demos intended to go to market for existing Elliott Davis healthcare clients. My director had experience in Tableau so some of the functionality has was used to was not natively built-in with this app, so this was a great challenge to push myself with what Power BI is capable of technically in order to provide a better solution. I also tested this project with a bit of Python scripting, and there are two V2 versions, depending on if the client wanted to see hygeine broken out or not.
