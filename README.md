# Power BI Professional Work Portfolio

This is a collection of selected projects I've worked on during my time as an analyst & consultant at Elliott Davis, from 2021-2023. Before joining I had no prior experience in Power BI or any business intelligence development, and it has been wonderful to aid clients in discovering more about their data while also building aesthetically pleasing frontend dashboards to present insights. All PDFs are exports of .pbix files I've worked on, and the data is scrubbed/modified to protect client identities. See below for brief project summaries and check out each folder's README for more details. Thank you!

## Projects Overview

### 01 Healthcare Practice Demos

These are a set of Power BI demos intended to go to market for existing Elliott Davis healthcare clients. My director had experience in Tableau so some of the functionality has was used to was not natively built-in with this app, so this was a great challenge to push myself with what Power BI is capable of technically in order to provide a better solution. I also tested this project with a bit of Python scripting, and there are two V2 versions, depending on if the client wanted to see hygiene broken out or not.

### 02 Healthcare Ongoing Dashboard

I was super encouraged when one of the first projects I worked on became a monthly addition to an existing client. My manager and I worked on developing this one together for a couple of months, fine-tuning it with the current engagement team, and this client loved it enough to make an addendum to subscribe for monthly updates on their data. As of now I am maintaining the production version of this file and providing analytics updates for them each month.

### 03 Automated Medical Financial Reporting

This was a great challenge with my manager to develop a solution for a client who had a manual and very time-consuming reporting process and needed something more efficient - not just for automating, but also making Power BI look less like a traditional dashboard and more like a printed report. We were able to help this client cut down their time from 1.5 weeks to about 1 day of making this report. This project was also featured in [10 External Webinar Dashboards](#10-external-webinar-dashboards) and [Case Study and Blog Posts](#case-study-and-blog-posts).

### 04 Private Equity Financial Reporting Automation

In a similar vein as [03 Automated Medical Financial Reporting](#03-automated-medical-financial-reporting), this one was another good challenge in transforming a client's existing financial reporting deck into a fully automated Power BI report. I took over this project half-way in and helped finish it up week by week, ensuring that the math and design matched what they needed. There were also some tricky formatting needs they had that was a good test to push myself in what I can develop in Power BI.

### 05 Current Client Analytics Demo

After working through [01 Healthcare Practice Demos](#01-healthcare-practice-demos), I was able to borrow quite of a few of the new functionalities I developed to make a potential addendum dashboard series for an existing Elliott Davis client. The main interest was analyzing how loans were paid off over time, and being able to slice and dice categories by different measures. It was satisfying being able to test different visuals and how they would work best given the provided data and what needed to be seen.
