They are culturally similar and are led by a single leader, called a nazir. Although the origins of the tribes vary, most Dar Hamid descend from Arabia. They are nomadic, moving around with their herds in search of vegetation. Because of their nomadic lifestyle, the Dar Hamid have very few items in their homes that do not have practical value. However, they are extremely hospitable by tradition, so their tents are often decorated with leather and wool in order to provide a more inviting environment. Traditionally, the Dar Hamid are Sunni Muslims, although it is generally a strictly cultural identification and most don't know much about Islam. Some forms of folk Islam are present among the Dar Hamid. For example, fakirs, or holy men, often make charms and then sell them to the people for personal profit.","It is difficult to establish trusting relationships with nomadic groups, and Sudan is not hospitable to Christian workers.","Please pray for Gospel radio to be widely available throughout Sudan, and that the people will learn of these broadcasts and will desire to listen.","There are probably no followers of Jesus Christ among this tribe today.

Early converts to Islam came from Bedouin tribes, and Sunni Islam is embedded and deeply rooted in Bedouin culture. Prayer is an integral part of Bedouin life. As there are no formal mosques in the desert, they pray where they are, facing the Ka 'aba in Mecca. Bedouins are suspicious and alert, not revealing much about their personal background.","Western Sahara is difficult for outsiders to enter, especially for any kind of Christian ministry. Also, the Bedouin will likely be suspicious of the intentions of workers.","Much sustained prayer is needed to prepare the Bedouin to receive the good news of Christ. Christian radio can penetrate the remote regions of the Sahara, as prayer continues.","There are likely no followers of Jesus among the Arosien Bedouin, but pray for those the Lord will soon lead to himself. Pray they will be sent disciplers and teachers to help them grow spiritually.","Pray the Bedouin will be given a growing desire to find forgiveness for their sin, and will yearn to know a loving God.","New Testament"

Each year they move the herds to where there is water and they usually plant crops in their fields to harvest upon their return. A few tribes live in farming communities or towns. Their houses are built of mud bricks with thatched roofs and they have corrals for the young animals inside the compounds.","The nomadic lifestyle of the Baggara makes it very difficult for missionaries to reach them. In addition, they have been Muslims since the thirteenth century and believe strongly in evil spirits, which causes very few to dare to seek and find Christ.","Believers with talents in veterinarian medicine can have regular contact with the Baggara peoples and share the love of Christ.","Ask God to encourage and protect the small number of converts.

Ironically, one of the characteristics of Druze adherents is their ability to blend in with people of other faiths and mindsets.

The traditional homeland of the Bedouin Arabs is the Arabian Desert; however, some Bedouin groups have migrated north into the Negev Desert region. Jordan was one of the first lands to be inhabited by the Bedouin, and today many Bedouin still live there, primarily raising sheep and goats. Nadji Bedouin Arabs have a relatively harsh existence. They have no permanent homes, but live in portable, black tents made from woven goat hair.","There is little or no Christian witness, nor any example of living Christianity for the Najdi Arabs to see or experience.","There is a need for missionaries who are willing and able to endure the severe conditions of the desert to reach them for Christ. They can use stories, poems and music that is appealing in their culture.","","Pray for these remote Muslims to have dreams and visions of the Risen Savior and be drawn to him.
Pray for workers who are willing to endure hardships, learn a difficult language, and produce gospel materials for these people who need to hear good news.
Pray for the rapid spread of the gospel among the Nadji Bedouin Arabs.","Portions"
