They moved to Mayotte Island in the latter half of the 19th century, and these immigrants and plantation workers still live there today. The older generations live according to the traditional ways, such as following the Islamic calendar and structuring their day around the five daily prayer times. The younger generations, who have been educated in the French secular system, now question some of their groups' traditions and seek the things of the West, such as material wealth, a less strict moral code, and a different manner of dress. Nevertheless, they proudly identify as Islamic. Most of them, however, still look more to spirits (djinns) to help with everyday needs or crises.","The Bushi identify as Muslim. To change one's religion is to change one's identity, which is painful especially in a culture that focuses on the group.","Christians who are open to God working through power encounters could help facilitate a new understanding of the spirit world.","Few follow Jesus today among the Bushi people. Pray they would find each other and meet together for encouragement and instruction in the faith.","Pray that the Lord would set the people free from djinn spirits and lead them into a movement to Christ.
