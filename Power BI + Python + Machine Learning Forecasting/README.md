## What I learned

Below are some code snippets I'm proud of from this project:

DAX formula for custom color formatting
```DAX

```

Using a DAX SWITCH and USERELATIONSHIP to let users control which category to view by
```DAX

```

DAX UNION table to combine fields from multiple tables
```DAX

```

## Useful Resources

- [Power BI: Filter by a measure in a slicer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZAL-QPn5Zc) - Filtering visuals by DAX measure values is not natively supported in Power BI but this video helped me find a clever solution
- [Power BI: Dynamic axes and legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e8a3o1w51M) - Perfect for making visuals with dynamic axes so users can pick what category they want to view by
- [Power BI: Date Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WybnTHDl-AM) - Quickly generate date tables to use in your data model
